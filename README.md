# Introduction : Employee Retention

Employee retention is the biggest challenge of many organisations. Employee retention is a phenomenon where employees choose to stay on with their current company and don’t actively seek other job prospects. Employees leave the organisation for a variety of reasons. The HR department of a software company wants to ensure that its employees do not quit their jobs.

# Current Practice

Once an employee leaves, he or she is taken an interview with the name “exit interview” and shares reasons for leaving. The HR Department then tries and learns insights from the interview and makes changes accordingly.

This suffers from the following problems:

This approach is that it's too haphazard. The quality of insight gained from an interview depends heavily on the skill of the interviewer.
The second problem is these insights can't be aggregated and interlaced across all employees who have left.
The third is that it is too late by the time the proposed policy changes take effect.

# Problem Statement 
Our Client is HR department of a software company. They are looking for a solution to retain their employees. For that,

They want to try a new initiative to retain employees.
The idea is to use data to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.
Once these employees are identified, HR can be more proactive in reaching out to them before it's too late.
They only want to deal with the data that is related to permanent employees.
HR Department has given datasets of past employees and their status (still employed or already left).
As a data science consultant, our task is to build a classification model to predict whether an employee will stay or leave.
Because there is no machine learning model for this problem in the company, there is no quantifiable win condition. A best possible model need to be built.
